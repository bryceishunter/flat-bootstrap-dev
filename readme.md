Flat Bootstrap Developer by XtremelySocial is a child theme for Flat Bootstrap. It is for developers to easily customize the theme. By default, it strips out all the "extra" CSS and Javascript from the parent theme.


== DESCRIPTION ==

Flat Bootstrap by XtremelySocial is a modern, fully responsive, "flat" style theme with a nice color palette, big full-width images, and full-width colored sections. It automatically adapts for desktops, tablets, and phones.

It is based on the standard WordPress starter theme (_S) and the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework. The theme was inspired by the HTML/CSS themes from Blacktie.co and color schemes from Designmodo.com’s flat UI.

Features include a mobile navigation bar, multiple columns (grid), buttons, icons, labels, badges, tabbed content areas, collapsible content areas, progress bars, alert boxes, carousels (sliders) and much, much more. This is a theme for both users and theme developers with lots of features but without the bloat. 

Users can download the Flat Bootstrap Child Theme to easily customize the theme. Theme developers can download the Flat Bootstrap Developer Theme that is also a child theme, but strips everything back to basic Bootstrap.

== TRANSLATIONS ==

The theme is translation ready, but I don't speak enough Spanish or any other language to translate it ;-) I will be more than happy to update the theme with new languages, if anyone wants to help out with that!


== INSTALLATION ==

1. Download the theme
2. Unzip the folder into the `/wp-content/themes/` directory
3. Activate the theme through the 'Appearance' menu in WordPress
4. Read the notes below about how to use this child theme


== SCREENSHOTS ==

For now, WordPress doesn't allow themes to have more than one screenshot, but you can go to [http://xtremelysocial.com/wordpress/developer/] to see a bunch of them.


== HOW TO USE THE THEME ==

This theme is a standard WordPress "child theme". It comes with a style.css file that you can edit to override the parent theme's CSS or add new CSS styles to use in your content. It also comes with a functions.php file in case you want to override any theme functions. If you want to make changes to any other files from the parent theme, copy the file down to the child theme directory and edit it there.

By using this child theme to customize Flat Bootstrap, you'll be able to upgrade that theme from WordPress.org to receive bug fixes and new features.

However, once you make changes to this child theme you should NOT update it from WordPress.org or you will lose your changes. To be safe, you may want to make a COPY of this child theme and edit that instead.

You can read more information about how to use child themes on WordPress.org [https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes]
